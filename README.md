- 👋 Hi, I’m @fishp0cket. I'm a Linux user with over a decade of experience in live and recorded sound engineering. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Audio Engineering, DSP, NAS, Power Efficiency, and extending the usable liftime of hardware.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust. The next steps are then Python, and some front-end JS. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Audio Plugins, and offloading parallel VST workloads to GPUs. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Carrier Pigeon, Smoke Signal, Mountain Beacon, or Talking Drums. 
 
I'd love to see full-fat Linux distributions be as popular on the desktop as MacOS, Windows, and Chrome OS. The way out of this hardware crisis is better software.
